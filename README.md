- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChristianOroscoP
- 👀 I’m interested in the creation of colaborative programs, in acquiring new knowledge about programming (I am a noob). Actually I dont have any friends or people who can help me in this new moment of my life :c.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Frond End, new program languages, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future (because actually I dont know anything about this)
- 📫 How to reach me:
Discord: Christian Orosco P.#1154
